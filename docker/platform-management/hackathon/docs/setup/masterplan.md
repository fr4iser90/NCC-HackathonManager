# Masterplan: Hackathon Platform

## Goal
A fully automated, containerized platform that can be set up with a single script/compose run and covers all core features (users, teams, projects, judging, security, monitoring).

---

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Generate/fill out all .env files**
3. **Build a central Docker Compose stack**
4. **Create a setup script for initialization (DB, admin, etc.)**
5. **Set up CI/CD workflows**
6. **Configure monitoring & backups**
7. **Automate security checks & testing**
8. **Finalize documentation & user guides**
9. **Develop project templates**
10. **Go-live & operations**
