# Debugging Workflows

## Manual Debugging
- Use logs, breakpoints, and test cases to identify and resolve issues.
- Document root causes and solutions in the issue tracker.

## AI-Driven Debugging
- AI scans logs, test failures, and error reports to suggest or auto-apply fixes for known issues.
- AI may run automated tests and static analysis to detect regressions.
- AI documents all actions and notifies maintainers of changes.

## Escalation
- If AI cannot resolve an issue, escalate to a human with detailed context, logs, and attempted solutions.
- Critical incidents must be flagged for immediate human review.
