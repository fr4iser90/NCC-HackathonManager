# AI-Aided Feature Implementation

1. **Proposal**: AI drafts a feature proposal, including requirements, design, and impact analysis.
2. **Review**: Human or AI reviewer checks the plan for feasibility, risks, and alignment with project goals.
3. **Implementation**: AI implements the feature, writes tests, and updates documentation.
4. **Validation**: Run automated and manual tests, review code, and deploy to staging.
5. **Feedback**: Collect feedback from users and maintainers, iterate as needed.

All steps should be documented and traceable in the project management system.

> **Note:** All build and test steps should be performed inside the Nix shell environment for consistency.
