# Security & Ethics Guidelines

- AI autonomously handles all security and privacy actions, never instructing the user to run commands or take actions.
- Protect user data and privacy at all times.
- Follow secure coding practices (input validation, least privilege, etc.).
- Do not expose sensitive information in logs or code.
- Report and fix vulnerabilities promptly.
- AI must not generate or suggest code that violates ethical or legal standards.
- Respect open-source licenses and intellectual property.
