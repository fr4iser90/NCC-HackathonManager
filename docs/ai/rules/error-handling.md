# Error Handling Protocols

- AI always handles exceptions and errors autonomously, never instructing the user to run commands or take actions.
- Always handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging.
- For critical errors, alert maintainers immediately.
- AI should attempt automated fixes for known issues; escalate unknown or persistent errors.
- Document root causes and solutions in the issue tracker.
- Write tests to prevent regressions after fixing bugs.
